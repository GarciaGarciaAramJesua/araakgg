My personal repository.
Hi! I'm Aram Garc√≠a
I'm Computational systems student and right now i'm in a external program on Linde SSC.
In my area, i love so much working on software projects documentation and frontend.
I have contributed with at least a dozen software projects, mostly in the documentation part, particularly in the specification of requirements requested by the projects, design and modeling of projects, of which the vast majority have been schools and with the aim of contributing technologies to these institutions.
